# retail-sales-etl-aws

## Retail Sales ETL Pipeline (AWS Project)
A cloud-based data engineering project that simulates daily retail sales processing using AWS.

### Tools Used

 - AWS S3 – for raw and cleaned data lake storage
 - AWS Glue – for PySpark-based ETL pipeline
 - AWS Athena – for serverless querying
 - AWS QuickSight – for dashboard visualization
 - Python & Faker – for generating mock retail data

### ETL Pipeline Flow

 - Raw Data uploaded to s3://retail-sales-data-ian/raw/
 - Glue Crawler registered raw CSVs as a table in the Glue Catalog
 - Glue Job transformed the data with PySpark (added total_price, cleaned date)
 - Transformed Data saved as Parquet to s3://retail-sales-data-ian/cleaned/
 - Crawler registered cleaned data table
 - Athena Queries calculated KPIs: revenue, units sold, top products
 - QuickSight Dashboard visualized sales trends and departmental insights

### Sample Insights from Athena
``` sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM cleaned_cleaned
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
