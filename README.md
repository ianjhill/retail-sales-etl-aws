# retail-sales-etl-aws

Retail Sales ETL Pipeline (AWS Project)
A cloud-based data engineering project that simulates daily retail sales processing using AWS.

Tools Used

AWS S3 â€“ for raw and cleaned data lake storage
AWS Glue â€“ for PySpark-based ETL pipeline
AWS Athena â€“ for serverless querying
AWS QuickSight â€“ for dashboard visualization
Python & Faker â€“ for generating mock retail data

ETL Pipeline Flow

Raw Data uploaded to s3://retail-sales-data-ian/raw/
Glue Crawler registered raw CSVs as a table in the Glue Catalog
Glue Job transformed the data with PySpark (added total_price, cleaned date)
Transformed Data saved as Parquet to s3://retail-sales-data-ian/cleaned/
Crawler registered cleaned data table
Athena Queries calculated KPIs: revenue, units sold, top products
QuickSight Dashboard visualized sales trends and departmental insights

Sample Insights from Athena
SELECT product_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM cleaned_cleaned
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
